What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the metadata directories and files to support a git repository. I need to do this because I want to track my versions of the reflections that I write.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By adding one file at a time to the staging area and doing a git status and git diff --staged, you can ensure that only changes that you want to commit are added to the staging area. if you have other changes, you can do a git reset after you have done the git commit.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some situations that are examples for creating a new branch are when creating an experimental feature, when doing a different language version without having special resource files that can handle different languages within the same branch. By creating a new branch for each of these siutations you don't need to worry about messing up the main branch which may be in production and need an emergency bug fix without dragging in unrelated code.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams show the tip of each branch and then the parent, parent of the parent etc. all the way back to the original commit with no parent. They also show where a branch started from a commit of the master branch.
